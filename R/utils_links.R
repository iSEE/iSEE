#' Upon changes to a transmitting panel \code{panel}, all other panels that receive selection information from \code{panel_name} may need to be updated.
#' This function identifies the set of children of \code{panel} that potentially require updates.
#' Whether they \emph{actually} need updates depends on the nature of the changes in \code{panel}, which will be context-specific.
#'
#' Note that this only refers to direct children.
#' If the selection effect is \code{"Restrict"} in any of the child panels, their children (i.e., the grandchildren of \code{panel}) would also need updating, and so on.
#' This is achieved via a set of observers to reactive values in \code{\link{iSEE}} to enable this recursion, see \code{\link{.create_child_propagation_observer}}.

#' Establish the evaluation order
#'
#' Establish the order in which panels are to be evaluated during app initialization,

#'
#' @param graph A graph object containing links between panels,
#' produced by \code{\link{.spawn_multi_selection_graph}} or friends.
#'
#' @details
#' These functions identify any initial connections between panels (e.g., specified in the panel arguments) for point selection.
#' The idea is to \dQuote{evaluate} the plots at the start of the app, to obtain the coordinates for transmitting to other panels.
#' Otherwise, errors will be encountered whereby a panel tries to select from a set of coordinates that do not yet exist.
#'
#' \code{.establish_eval_order} is intended for use in the multiple selection graph;
#' the connected panels are returned in an order such that any transmitters are placed in front of their receivers.
#' This is necessary to accommodate complex DAGs where one panel transmits to another, which transmits to another, and so on.
#'
#' \code{.has_child} is intended for use in the single selection graph and will simply report all transmitting panels.
#' There is no need to order dependencies as all single selections exert their effects through a named parameter that is watched by an observer; we can thus rely on the observers to propagate all necessary effects.
#'
#' Note that only transmitting panels are ever reported by this function.
#' It is not necessary to evaluate receiving-only panels.

#' Spawn the dynamic selection source lists
#'
#' Create a list of all panels that can respond to a dynamic source of multiple or single selections.
#'
#' @param all_memory A named list of \linkS4class{Panel} objects representing the current state of the application.
#'
#' @return A list of two named lists of character vectors.
#' Each internal vector corresponds to a panel and contains all fields responding to a dynamic row/column source in that panel.
#' 
#' For multiple selections, only one field will be present for each panel (i.e., the row/column selection source),
#' but for single selections, multiple fields may be present depending on the contents of \code{\link{.singleSelectionSlots}}.
#'
#' For multiple selections, the two internal lists are named \code{"row"} and \code{"column"}.
#' For single selections, they are instead named \code{"feature"} and \code{"sample"}, 
#' consistent with the nomenclature in the rest of the package.
#' 
#' @details
#' The idea is to provide a quick reference that can be used in \code{\link{.requestActiveSelectionUpdate}} and friends,
#' to trigger resetting of the links between panels that are involved in a dynamic multiple selection source scheme.
#' A similar principle applies to single selections via the observer in \code{\link{.create_dimname_propagation_observer}}.
#'
#' Note that the panels that might serve as dynamic sources for multiple selections
#' are always a subset of those that can respond to dynamic sources.
#' This is imposed by the desire to avoid circularity problems - 
#' see \code{?\link{.requestActiveSelectionUpdate}} for details.
