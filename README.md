## Overview

The _iSEE_ package provides an interactive user interface for exploring data in objects derived from the `SummarizedExperiment` class.
Particular focus is given to single-cell data stored in the `SingleCellExperiment` derived class.
The user interface is implemented with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com)'s [_Shiny_](https://shiny.rstudio.com), with a multi-panel setup for ease of navigation.

This initiative was proposed at the European Bioconductor Meeting in Cambridge, 2017.
Current contributors include:

- [Charlotte Soneson](https://github.com/csoneson)
- [Aaron Lun](https://github.com/LTLA)
- [Federico Marini](https://github.com/federicomarini)
- [KÃ©vin Rue-Albrecht](https://github.com/kevinrue)

## Installation

_iSEE_ can be easily installed from Bioconductor using `BiocManager::install()`:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("iSEE")
# or also...
BiocManager::install("iSEE", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Setting `dependencies = TRUE` should ensure that all packages, including the ones in the `Suggests:` field of the `DESCRIPTION`, are installed - this can be essential if you want to reproduce the code in the vignette, for example.

## Functionalities

<details>
<summary><b>
Click to expand the list of features available in <i>iSEE</i> applications.
</b></summary>  

### General

* Multiple interactive plot types with selectable points.

* Interactive tables with selectable rows.

* Coloring of samples and features by metadata or expression data.

* Zooming to a plot subregion.

* Transmission of point selections between panels to highlight, color, or restrict data points in the receiving panel(s).

* Lasso point selection to define complex shapes.

### Sample-level visualization

The _iSEE_ user interface currently contains the following components where each data point represents a single biological sample:

*  **Reduced dimension plot**: Scatter plot of reduced dimensionality data.

* **Column data plot**: Adaptive plot of any one or two sample metadata.
A scatter, violin, or square design is dynamically applied according to the continuous or discrete nature of the metadata.

* **Feature assay plot**: Adaptive plot of expression data across samples for any two features or one feature against one sample metadata.

* **Column data table**: Table of sample metadata.

### Feature-level visualization

The _iSEE_ user interface currently contains the following components where each data point represents a genomic feature:

* **Row data plot**: Adaptive plot of any two feature metadata.
A scatter, violin, or square design is dynamically applied according to the continuous or discrete nature of the metadata.

* **Sample assay plot**: Adaptive plot of expression data across features for any two samples or one sample against one feature metadata.

* **Row data table**: Table of feature metadata.

### Integrated visualization

The _iSEE_ user interface contains the following components that integrate sample and feature information:

* **Complex heatmap plot**: Visualize multiple features across multiple samples annotated with sample metadata.

### Custom panels

The _iSEE_ API allows users to programmatically define their own plotting and table panels.
See the section [Extending _iSEE_](#extending-isee) further below.

### Miscellaneous

* The _iSEE_ user interface continually tracks the code corresponding to all visible plotting panels.
This code is rendered in a [shinyAce](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinyAce/index.html) text editor and can be copy-pasted into R scripts for customization and further use.

* Speech recognition can be enabled to control the user interface using voice commands.

## Want to try _iSEE_?

We set up instances of _iSEE_ applications running on diverse types of datasets at those addresses:

- http://shiny.imbei.uni-mainz.de:3838/iSEE
- https://marionilab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/iSEE_allen
- https://marionilab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/iSEE_tcga
- https://marionilab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/iSEE_pbmc4k
- https://marionilab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/iSEE_cytof

Please keep in mind that those public instances are for trial purposes only;
yet they demonstrate how you or your system administrator can setup _iSEE_ for analyzing or sharing your precomputed `SummarizedExperiment`/`SingleCellExperiment` object.

## Extending _iSEE_

If you want to extend the functionality of _iSEE_, you can create custom panels which add new possibilities to interact with your data.
Custom panels can be defined in independent R packages that include _iSEE_ in the `Imports:` sections of their DESCRIPTION file.
You can find a collection of working examples of how to do it in [iSEEu](https://github.com/iSEE/iSEEu).
Feel free to contact the developing team, should you need some clarifications on how _iSEE_ works internally.
