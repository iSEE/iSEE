\title{Set and get app-level options}
\usage{
registerAppOptions(se, ...)

getAppOption(name, se, default = NULL)

getAllAppOptions(se)
}
\arguments{
\item{se}{The \linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment} object to be supplied to \code{\link{iSEE}}.}

\item{...}{Named options to register.
Alternatively a single named list containing the options to register.}

\item{name}{String containing the name of the option to retrieve.}

\item{default}{Value to return if \code{name} is not present in the available options.}
}
\value{
\code{registerAppOptions} will return \code{se}, modified with the application-level options.

\code{getAppOption} will return the value of the specified option, or \code{default} if that option is not available.

\code{getAllAppOptions} will return a named list of all registered options.
}
\description{
Set and get global options for the \code{\link{iSEE}} application.
These are options that do not correspond to any \linkS4class{Panel} slot and cannot be changed by the user after initialization.
}
\details{
\code{registerAppOptions} provides an alternative mechanism for setting global options, separate from \code{\link{panelDefaults}}.
The primary difference is that \code{registerAppOptions} allows tuning of options that do not have a corresponding slot in any \linkS4class{Panel} subclass.
This makes it useful for parameters that the user should not or cannot change within the application,
as well as for fine-tuning parameters that are too rarely used to have their own interface elements.

Known options include:
\itemize{
\item{\code{panel.color}}{Named character vector of colors.
The names of the vector should be set to the name of class to be overridden; if a class is not named here, its default color is used.
It is highly recommended to define colors as hex color codes (e.g., \code{"#1e90ff"}), for full compatibility with both HTML elements and R plots.}
\item{\code{color.maxlevels}}{Maximum number of levels for a categorical variable used for coloring.
Variables with more levels are coerced to numeric to avoid problems with an overly-large legend.
Defaults to 24.}
\item{\code{factor.maxlevels}}{Maximum number of levels for a categorical variable to be used anywhere in the app.
Variables with more levels are coerced to numeric to avoid rendering delays.
Defaults to 100.}
\item{\code{RowTable.select.details}}{A function that takes a string containing the name of a feature (i.e., the current selection in the \linkS4class{RowTable}) and returns a HTML element with more details.} 
\item{\code{ColumnTable.select.details}}{A function that takes a string containing the name of a sample (i.e., the current selection in the \linkS4class{ColumnTable}) and returns a HTML element with more details.}
\item{\code{tooltip.rowdata}}{A character vector specifying columns of the \code{\link{rowData}} to show in the tooltip for \linkS4class{ColumnDotPlot} instances. Defaults to \code{character(0)}, which displays only the `colnames` value.}
\item{\code{tooltip.coldata}}{A character vector specifying columns of the \code{\link{colData}} to show in the tooltip for \linkS4class{RowDotPlot} instances. Defaults to \code{character(0)}, which displays only the `rownames` value.}
}

The registered options are stored in the SummarizedExperiment to ensure that we can recover the application state with the combination of the SummarizedExperiment and list of Panel settings.
By comparison, if we had used a global cache as in \code{\link{panelDefaults}}, we would need to save them separately to ensure that we can recover a particular application state.

By default, \code{registerAppOptions} will add or replace individual arguments specified by \code{...}.
This means that users can call the function multiple times to accumulate registered options in \code{se}.
The exception is if \code{...} contains a single list, in which case the entire set of options is directly replaced by that list.
For example, one could supply a single empty list to clear \code{se} of all existing options.

\section{For developers}{

Developers of Panel subclasses can add arbitary options to \code{...} to help control the behavior of their Panel instances.
We recommend prefixing any options with the name of the package in the form of \code{<PACKAGE>_<OPTION>},
so as to avoid conflicts with other options (in the base classes, or in other downstream packages) that have the same name.

For calls to \code{\link{getAppOption}} that occur after the \code{\link{iSEE}} app has started, it is not actually necessary to supply \code{se}.
The options in \code{se} are transferred to a global option store when the app starts, allowing us to call \code{\link{getAppOption}} without \code{se} in various Panel methods.
This is useful for some generics where \code{se} is not part of the function signature.
Developers can mimic this state (e.g., for unit testing) by calling \code{\link{.activateAppOptionRegistry}} on the SummarizedExperiment produced by \code{\link{registerAppOptions}}.
Conversely, calling \code{\link{.deactivateAppOptionRegistry}} will reset the global option store.

\examples{
se <- SummarizedExperiment()
se <- registerAppOptions(se, factor.maxlevels=10, color.maxlevels=10)

getAppOption("factor.maxlevels", se)
getAppOption("color.maxlevels", se)
getAppOption("random.other.thing", se, default=10)

getAllAppOptions(se)

# For developers: you don't actually need to pass 'se' to the getters
# if they are being called inside Panel methods.
.activateAppOptionRegistry(se)
getAppOption("factor.maxlevels")
getAppOption("color.maxlevels")
.deactivateAppOptionRegistry()

# Wiping out all options.
se <- registerAppOptions(se, list())
getAllAppOptions(se)
